This is a webpage I created early in my journey to solidify my knowledge in HTML sematics and CSS properties and structures. 
Althought this project was designed from a Desktop-first approach I wanted to practice how to develop a responsive interface. 
For that, I chose to do a rough copy of the first page from the magazine https://wovenmagazine.com/.
